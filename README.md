My first readme

The following steps is a short discription of we were able to build
this project and it's essence

You pushed your first file in your first repository of the first task of your first ALX School project
Create a new directory called 0x03-git in your alx-zero_day repo

Make sure you include a not empty README.md in your directory
Create these directories at the root of your project: bash, c, js
Create these empty files

Collaboration is the base of a company
adding a feature in development
collaborating on the same project with other developers
not breaking your entire repository
not upsetting your co-workers
Of course, you can also work on the same branch as your co-workers and 
itâ€™s best if you keep up to date with their changes
